# Guidance

Buttons are an interactive graphical control element that triggers an event or action.

### Button Types
<div className="button-types-table">
  |type   |behavior|
  |-------|--------|
  |submit |The button submits the form data to the server.  This is the default behavior of button element for buttons associated with a `<form>`,  if the attribute is not specified, or if the attribute is an empty or invalid value.|
  |button |The button has no default behavior, and does nothing when pressed by default. It can have client-side scripts listen to the element's events, which are triggered when the events occur.|
  |reset  |This type <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/reset" target="_blank">resets all the controls</a> to their initial values, like `<input type="reset">`. (This behavior tends to annoy users.)|
