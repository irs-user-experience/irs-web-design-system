# Welcome to the IRS Design System

The IRS Design System (formerly called the Online Design Guide, or ODG) is a tool that provides design standards for IRS applications, products, and services. It seeks to create a consistent online experience for IRS customers by using a design system developed with industry best practices, validated by user testing, and driven by the IRS brand.

## What is a design system?

A design system is a repository of design components used to create our various websites and applications. These pre-made components take the guesswork out of what they should look like, interaction guidelines, and how they are coded.

## What is Storybook?

Storybook is a way to view production-ready code, created directly from our design system in Figma. It allows developers to see the latest design specifics for their reusable components.

## Design System Benefits

Design systems increase the usability of digital applications and decrease the time it takes to develop them.

    ### Benefits for Developers
    This design system is a repository of reusable code snippets for all IRS applications and websites. Not only does this increase coding efficiency, but it also gives developers the ability to view, edit, and test components in isolation.
